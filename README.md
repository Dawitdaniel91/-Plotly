# Plotly (Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard)

# Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer.The volunteers are should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.
## The project outline
Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard
Deliverable 5: A written report on the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard analysis README.md.

# Resources
Data Source: BellyButton_bar_chart_starter_code.js, BellyButton_bubble_chart_starter_code.js, BellyButton_bubble_chart_starter_code.js and index.html
Data Tools: ECMAScript, JavaScript, JSON and IO (Web Server)
Software: ES6+, ECMAScript and Visual Studio Code 1.50.0

## Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
By using knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.

## Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
By Using knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a bubble chart that will display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:

The otu_ids as the x-axis values.
The sample_values as the y-axis values.
The sample_values as the marker size.
The otu_ids as the marker colors.
The otu_labels as the hover-text values.

### Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
By Using knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

## Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard

By Using knowledge of HTML and Bootstrap customize the webpage for dashboard.
### style.css code
Code and Image:
body {
    color: #000000;
    background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
}

.tag {
    font-family: inherit;
    font-size: 1rem;
}

.jumbotron {
    background-image: url("../images/Belly Button Biodiversity.PNG");
    background-size: 100% 100%;
    text-align: center;
}

### When the dashboard is first opened in a browser, ID 940’s data should be displayed in the dashboard, and the three charts should be working according to their requirements.
